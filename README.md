**<h1>Myntra-Clone</h1>**


I'll help you setting up Myntra Clone with Component Structure: 
1- cd project
2- npm i
3- npm run dev
I've created a well-structured Myntra clone with the following features:

<h3>Component Structure:</h3>

Reusable components like ProductCard and ProductGrid
Layout components like Header
Separate pages for Home and Admin dashboard
State Management:

Using Zustand for global state management
Separate stores for authentication and cart
Type Safety:

TypeScript interfaces for Products, Users, and Cart items
Routing:

React Router for navigation
Protected admin routes
Styling:

Tailwind CSS for responsive design
Clean and modern UI similar to Myntra
The development server is now running. You can continue building on this foundation by:

Adding more pages (Product details, Cart, Checkout)
Implementing authentication
Adding more admin features
Creating user profile pages
Implementing search functionality

I've set up a complete authentication system with the following features:

<h3>Login System:</h3>

Demo credentials provided:
Admin: admin@myntra.com / admin123
User: user@example.com / user123
Form validation and error handling
Role-based redirection (admin → admin panel, user → profile)
Registration System:

New users can create accounts
Automatic login after registration
Form validation and error handling
Authentication Store:

Global state management using Zustand
Persistent user session
Role-based access control
Mock Backend:

Simulated authentication API
User data storage
Password validation
To test the system:

<h3>Admin Access:</h3>

Use admin@myntra.com / admin123
Access the admin dashboard at /admin
Full access to product, order, and user management
User Access:

Use user@example.com / user123
Regular user features
Cannot access admin dashboard
New Users:

Register through the registration form
Automatically assigned 'user' role
Redirected to profile after registration
The development server is now running with the updated authentication system. Would you like me to add any additional features or make any modifications?
